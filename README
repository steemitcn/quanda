What is it
==========

Quanda is a community-driven question and answer framework.

It is open source and written as a django reusable application.
 
Install
=======

* Add the quanda directory to your python site-packages

* Add quanda to your installed apps
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'quanda',
    ...
)
 
* Include the url file to your urls:
urlpatterns = pattern('',
   ...
   (r'^quanda/', include('quanda.urls'),
   ...
)
 
* sync the db:
$ python manage.py syncdb

* run the install view
Once you have quanda up and running, go to /install to run the install process
(this has to be done as a staff user)

* note: for the default templates that you'll no doubt override, quanda assumes
that your login as at /accounts/login, your registration at /accounts/register/
and your logout as /accounts/logout.

* Quanda uses TinyMCE_ in the ask question and answer question textareas. You
should specify the location of your tiny_mce.js file  in the
TINY_MCE_JS_LOCATION config variable. If quanda doesn't find it, it will use
the js file from teebes.com instead
